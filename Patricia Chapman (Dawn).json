Patricia states that she is a current resident of Baker House. However, she states that due to her not being able to complete her AB Works medical form she is choosing to live at the DI. When asked if she has been evicted she states that she has not received any notice. When writer offered to support Patricia with connecting her to the DI Health Services Team she stats that due to her past experiences with physicians she will not engage and stated that she has accepted that she will \"live and die\" at the DI. Soon after this conversation Patricia grew irate and chose to disengage. Writer connect Patricia with Act. Supervisor Nicole, who was able to connect with her.

Writer offered Patricia some dry snacks, but she refused to take them. Earlier during breakfast time, (cereal with milk) she said she was starving but not enough to eat that sh*** and left the dining area without eating.  Patricia left the window for a few minutes and came back. Writer was able to engage with her again and offered her a sandwich which she took, saying \u201cyes, anything that is food\u201d.  Writer explained the phone that was for client's use is broken but we can arrange for her to use the phone. She said she\u2019ll come back at around 9:00 am.  For the laundry (hygiene) writer also said it will probably be open at around 2pm.  Patricia was ok with that; she left the floor to get a Tim\u2019s coffee.  She came back to the floor and she apologized to writer for her past \u201cgrumpiness \u201csaying she gets like that when she is hungry.  Writer reconfirmed we are here to help her and try to provide the support she needs while this transitional time; she disclosed she won\u2019t be here too long. She also said she\u2019ll be seeing the doctor tomorrow; she has an appointment and is planning to attend.  <br/><br/><b>Log ID:</b> LOG00419017"

Writer heard a loud noise coming from the 5th floor smoke deck. on getting there, writer saw Anisa Mohamed (2-14-1990) and Patricia Chapman (20-11-1975) engaged in a verbal altercation. Anisa was at the verge of physically attacking Patricia when writer immediately withheld her from such action. Eventually, both clients were able to de-escalate. Writer proceeded to have a conversation with Anisa regarding her aggressive behavior, she stated that Patricia was calling her names using derogatory words to describe her. writer validated her feeling however, she was made to understand that engaging in a physical altercation is not acceptable and allowed on the floor, if she has any issue with any client she should report it to a staff member not taken laws into her hands, as such aggressive behavior is harmful and will not be tolerated. Anisa apologized for her behavior and promised not to respond in such manner.  A warning has been given. Writer later proceeded to have a word with Patricia Chapman regarding what transpired between her and Anisa in the smoke deck. Patricia was perplexed, stating that nothing happened between her and Anisa. She seemed to exhibit some level of mild cognitive impairment evident by her inability to state or recall what happened at the smoke deck. On the other note, her affect was incongruent with the situation at hand. Logging for M.H conce<br/><br/><b>Log ID:</b> LOG0042403"
