Writer explained there is never a circumstance that we will ever share any clients name with another client as that breeches our FOIP policy to protect everyone equally in the building.  A second conversation with Darlene was had and she informed writer that while she was in the \"Pen\", the guards and other female inmates came into her cell and beat her, raped her, and drugged her.  When they were done with the attack they then brought in a male prisoner to kill her by beating her and kicked her 10-15 times. When the beating was over she then stated that she was heald in solitary confinment for 3 months and during this time the guards and prisoners came into her cell to drug, rape and beat her daily. She now shared that while on the smoke deck she recognized this male prisoner who assulted her to be this client Shawn, but does not know his name.  Darlene wanted writer to call the police to have them come up to 3rd floor and arrest him and charge him with the assult in prison.  Writer explained that this crime did not happen in our building so we could not call police regarding this, however if she wanted to call police on her own accord that was her business.  Writer did also tell Darlene that it was unlikely that police could just walk in the building and hunt Shawn down to get his name to give to her, as the building is a safe place for everyone.  Darelene then stated she could not call city police as she has warrents out for her arrest, and the assult had happened in RCMP jurisdiction.  Writer advised her that maybe it would be best to call RCMP on Monday and discuss this assult with them.  Writer also strongly advised Darlene to not discuss this with other clients to protect herself as well as to not confront Shawn in any way whatsoever.  However to please come to any staff at anytime if she was feeling unsafe or needed to talk.  Writer then left the conversation as Darlene seemed to have settled. A short time later Security Gerardo informed writer that Darlene did in fact call CPS units 1115 and B150 attended spoke with Darlene and she was informed from the officerrs that they could not give her any information on the individual.<br/><br/><b>Log ID:</b> LOG00009016"
