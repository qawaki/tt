I also told him that I knew that there had been a similar situation earlier in the week and that he needs to stop telling people what to do.

Michael has pointed out to staff twice now that Colin Anderson doesn\u2019t seem to be following the \u201c2 cups or 1 travel mug\u201d rule. It should be noted that Colin is one of our volunteers who stays late to clean the building and has been doing this daily for many years. As such, he has access to the remaining coffee after the clients have left and can take as much as he likes. Instead, Colin chooses to take two thermoses when he wakes up. Staff feel this is fair.  Our first discussion with Michael on this topic escalated and resulted in a bar. In an attempt to avoid this escalation I decided to keep the conversation short and explain to Michael that it is not up to him to police coffee consumption. Staff have since spoken to Colin to ask that he wait until later to take his second thermos of coffee so as not to bother Michael. If any staff finds themselves addressing this issue with Michael, please redirect him to pay attention to his own behavior rather than the business of his fellow residents. <br/><br/><b>Log ID:</b> LOG00020237"
