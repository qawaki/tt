As a note Erin does sweep up in the washroom and her room, but her condition is fairly severe and does cause trails of skin to be left in various places. At the end of the discussion Erin stated that we totally embarrassed her, and were picking on her because of her condition. Yet other clients are allowed to call her a hooker. She left office extremely upset, said she would move to 3rd (which was never asked of her). Hopefully she'll settle down in the morning, and be able to asset with working to a reasonable compromise. Erin also stated it was our fault that she could not get out of here because we were not helping her to acess the funds she needs to move out.
