2012-04-20,LOG00029912,"This morning while riding the morning bus back to the main building, Colin Anderson started trying to intimidate Michael Mens. Michael did start the confrontation by mouthing off about Colin for talking to me. Michael backed down when I spoke with him but Colin elbowed Michael in the head while trying to crown him. Colin then kicked Michael all while I was watching but acted like he was doing nothing wrong. This was all done within a few feet from the driver while the bus was moving. After a discussion with Spvr Jeremiah, Colin has received a 7 day bar from 2507.",Bus Confrontation Between Colin and Michael
2014-03-23,LOG00345830,"When opening 2507 Colin Anderson and Jason Becker got into an argument. Colin asked me to deal with it so I decided to speak to them both separately. Jason told me that Colin keeps getting in everyone’s business and that he was being rude to him by calling him a rat. When Jason left the office the argument continued between him and Colin, with Jason following Colin into the washroom. I tried to ask Colin what was going on but he told me that nothing had happened and then told me that, “you’re the one with the cameras and recorders you tell me.” He also for a brief moment accused Jason of hitting him and then dropped the accusation. He continued to refuse to tell me what happened and then accused me of trying to provoke a situation with him. I told him that I was just trying to find out what was going on like he had asked me to do which he was now denying. I also told him that I knew that there had been a similar situation earlier in the week and that he needs to stop telling people what to do. I also told him that if this continues I will have to send him back.",Colin's Dispute with Jason at 2507
2017-12-07,LOG00020237,"Michael approached staff this morning again concerned with the amount of coffee being taken by another client. Michael has pointed out to staff twice now that Colin Anderson doesn’t seem to be following the “2 cups or 1 travel mug” rule. It should be noted that Colin is one of our volunteers who stays late to clean the building and has been doing this daily for many years. As such, he has access to the remaining coffee after the clients have left and can take as much as he likes. Instead, Colin chooses to take two thermoses when he wakes up. Staff feel this is fair.  Our first discussion with Michael on this topic escalated and resulted in a bar. In an attempt to avoid this escalation I decided to keep the conversation short and explain to Michael that it is not up to him to police coffee consumption. Staff have since spoken to Colin to ask that he wait until later to take his second thermos of coffee so as not to bother Michael. If any staff finds themselves addressing this issue with Michael, please redirect him to pay attention to his own behavior rather than the business of his fellow residents.

2020-06-22,LOG00405598,"1000 - Called by XA Nathaniel to speak to Colin A (E4) because he was refusing to go to the Mustard Seed. When I spoke to him, he complained bitterly about the last day being changed from July 3 to June 26, and that the information given at the town hall changed and was not communicated to clients (although he admitted to reading the annoucements on the posted sheets of paper). He did not appear to be swayed when I informed him that that’s what we are in the process of doing right now. He again refused to go to the Mustard Seed and said he would go roam the streets once TCC closed. I told him that that was his decision and we would not force him to go, but the option was there if he wanted it.",Colin's Resistance to Relocate to the Mustard Seed
