                "text": "\"Victim's attack on rapist should lower sentence\"- Lawyer. (Calgary Sun Kevin Martin November 15, 2011). The homeless man who raped a Good Samaritan who\u2019d taken him into his home should be given credit for the fact he was beaten by his victim, his lawyer said Tuesday. Defence counsel Mitch Stephensen, in seeking a sentence of less than two years, said Leslie Four Horns has already suffered a form of street justice. That\u2019s because Four Horns was severely assaulted by his victim after the man awoke to find the offender on top of him in his southeast Calgary home, Stephensen said. \u201cTo some extent some punishment, some natural justice if you will, has already been administered by the victim,\u201d Stephensen said. He told provincial court Judge Catherine Skene that fact, coupled with Four Horns\u2019 remorse, his early guilty plea and his lack of a prior sexual record, should keep his client out of a federal penitentiary. But Crown prosecutor Sarah Bhola argued a sentence in the 3 1/2- to four-year range was justified for the attack last June 25. Four Horns, 30, was living on the street when his victim emerged from a 17 Ave. S.W. bar and ran into him. Believing he could help Four Horns to get a job and clean up, the victim invited him to return to his home to spend the night. Several hours later the 28-year-old man awoke in his own bed to find Four Horns raping him. Stephensen said his highly intoxicated client had no recollection of the assault and said Four Horns may have believed he was with a woman. Skene will attempt to make a sentencing decision Wednesday.<a href = 'http://www.calgarysun.com/2011/11/15/victims-attack-on-rapist-should-lower-sentence-lawyer'> Link to Article</a><br/><br/><b>Log ID:</b> LOG00321207"
