2002-11-16,LOG00248952,"Talked with Erin reference the concerns of other clients with her skin condition. This did not go well! She continually accused another client of calling her a hooker, said she helps on various levels with the computer lab etc. (this is true but was not what we were discussing) any time Ed or myself tried to work to find a solution Erin tried to deflect and state what other clients are doing, calling her etc. We asked Erin if it were possible for her not to rub, or pick at her skin in the smoke room. As a note Erin does sweep up in the washroom and her room, but her condition is fairly severe and does cause trails of skin to be left in various places. At the end of the discussion Erin stated that we totally embarrassed her, and were picking on her because of her condition. Yet other clients are allowed to call her a hooker. She left office extremely upset, said she would move to 3rd (which was never asked of her). Hopefully she'll settle down in the morning, and be able to asset with working to a reasonable compromise.
