David continually presents as defiant, aggressive, disrespectful and threatening. His past bars indicate where these have eventually lead. For having his bar lifted it would be ideal if David himself could come up with solutions to ensure he can function well in the centre for longer periods of time. Possibly a commitment from him to avoid the centre when he is under the influence could help in this endeavour. At the very least David needs to understand how his actions are perceived by staff, and understand the unwillingness to continually subject ourselves and other clients to these behaviours. His history indicates he has been barred 21 times for mostly similar behaviour since the implementation of his assessment bar, leading to the conclusion it is currently not the most effective option.<br/><br/><b>Log ID:</b> LOG00022465"

Several attempts by different staff were made to try and convince Client David to leave property. But, Client David decided to stay put in the front vestibule. Supervisor Sarah spoke with Client David, and he did eventually go outside; but, not before throwing used sheets at her face, excessively yelling and swearing at her; referring to her as a \u201cbitch\u201d. It was not long later before Client David made his way back inside, and made himself comfortable once again in the front vestibule. Writer and Supervisor Sarah approached Client David again to speak with him, however we found him with very shallow breathing and was unresponsive to extensive pain stimuli (via behind the ear and a sternum rub).

After consulting with Acting SUP Nicole E, Writer decided to check THOK's beverages for alcohol with the support of ACW Sean B. THOK was immediately uncompliant but not overly aggressive until Writer and ACW Sean B followed him out onto the 2nd Floor Smoke Deck, at which time THOK entered ACW Sean B's personal space and began to shout at him. Security was radioed for additional support and SEC Chloe V arrived at the 2nd Floor Smoke Deck to assist. Her presence and involvement calmed THOK who poured one of his drinks down the drain and gave ACW Sean B the other to empty. Writer had a discussion with THOK explaining that he needed to avoid escalating and yelling while he was on the floor and ACW Sean B had a similar conversation with THOK, stating that THOK would need to leave the building if he had any more incidents. THOK was reasonably well behaved until 12:45PM at which time Writer witnessed him unprovoked shove another client and posture at him in the 2nd Floor Men's Washroom. Writer separated the two clients and asked THOK to leave the floor. THOK took a significant period of time to leave, to the point that SEC Chloe V arrived on the floor to assist Writer with helping THOK leave. THOK eventually did leave property and Acting SUP Nicole E placed a CAT 2 Bar on THOK due to hi having multiple CAT 1 Bars from the last week period, minor harm caused to another client, a failure to deescalate and unwanted physical touching with Writer and SEC Chloe V. <br/><br/><b>Log ID:</b> LOG00422676"

Writer responded to the Lobby and was able to capture THOK's attention due to previous rapport, eventually leading to him agreeing to utilize an amnesty tote for the large bottle of alcohol he was carrying. However while he was toting it THOK proceeded to drink from the bottle which lead to SEC Adnan S prompting him to leave property and THOK responding by once more becoming aggressive towards him. Writer was able to recapture his attention and due to his high level of intoxication it was decided that THOK could remain on property provided he was not aggressive further to staff. Writer then began to walk THOK towards Riverfront at which time he informed Writer that if he \"was a women, [he] would want to be with Writer\" and proceeded to grab Writer's left shoulder. Writer initially assumed the contact was due to THOK tripping as a result of intoxication, however THOK then moved to touch the right side of Writer's chest with his right hand and Writer moved their shoulder to block/stop the contact by turning inward. The contact was then played off a friendly contact until THOK's hand was also moved from Writer's shoulder after which he reiterated the previous comment towards Writer of if he was a women, before being redirected into Riverfront by Writer.

The nurse checked DAVIDS eyes with a penlight while writer held DAVIDS head up and she reported that he had pinpoint pupils. DAVID is known to be a heavy drinker but is not known to use drugs, however under the circumstances and not knowing if someone had slipped him anything or he decided to try something new, all staff involved agreed to administer Naloxone to be safe. The first dose was given at 5:42, and the second at 5:46 and a 911 call was placed by ACW Amanda.  Paramedics arrived on scene at approximately 6:05 and did a check of all of DAVIDS vitals.  DAVID responded to the needles by moving his leg away but throughout the assessment DAVID still did not open his eyes or give any verbal response.  After a thorough assessment it was decided that DAVID would use a medical matt in the lobby and checked on a regular basis. Paramedics recommended that if he remained unresponsive in a couple hours to give them a call back.
