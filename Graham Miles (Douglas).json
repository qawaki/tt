I told Graham that it was unfortunate that he had missed breakfast, but ultimately he should be responsible for how he chose to act. Graham immediately escalated and stated that he sick of the stupid bitches that get hired to work here, and the first thing he would do when he got in the building was lock him self in a shower and masturbate to thoughts of that stupid girl getting raped.
