May explained that Harrison said \"If you don't like it, you can leave.\" Writer could hear Harrison in the background calmly saying, \"That's not what I said, May, that's not what I said.\" May was screaming at writer saying \"Move me out Karlii, he's kicking me out.\" Writer tried to help to calm May down as receiving calls from May screaming happens MANY times a day. May hung up. Harrison (landlord) called immediately afterwards to explain that he did not kick her out or speak down to May at all. He simply said that her and the roommates need to split chores. While on the phone with Harrison, Kual called writer (roommate in same unit) Kual attempted to explain how that situation felt for him. Kual was upset about how May treated Harrison, he also shared that May is making the living situation hostile. While on the phone writer could hear May screaming very loudly in the background. Threats, name-calling, etc. Writer reminded Kual of how hard he has been working and to remain level-headed. Writer suggested him to close his door, turn on some music and do his best to ignore the situation. While writer was reassuring Kual, May was texting writer accusing her of disclosing her case to Kual, not respecting her privacy, etc. Writer called May, May immediately started screaming about confidentiality. Writer explained that May is not writers only client, therefore, I'm expected to support all parties appropriately. Writer also reassured May that at no point does writer discuss anyone else's personal info and privacy is number one. May did not believe writer and was hurling insults at writer. Writer told May her anger was extremely displaced and to approach writer with a different attitude and level of respect on Monday.<br/><br/><b>Log ID:</b> LOG00506215"
